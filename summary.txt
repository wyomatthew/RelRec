RelRec is a program utilizing the Yelp API to take a user's inputed geocoordinates and search details to return a 
sorted list of recommended nearby businesses. Program makes use of cosine similarity to identify businesses that 
need to be recommended and uses triadic closure for making friend recommendations based prior users' full look-up 
history of categories.

Categories Used

- Social Networks
- Physical Networks (Internet)

Work Breakdown
-----------------
Matthew Pickering - implemented all helper functions for getting and parsing API calls from Yelp API in YelpGetter.java. 
In addition, implemented Business.java and Category.java to handle responses from Yelp API. The most important 
implemented methods include getBusinesses(), getValidCategories(), getContentsFromRequest(), and parseJsonStringToObject(). 
Finally, implemented static variables at top of YelpGetter to permit easy testing and building of requests.

Tinatin Kokoshvili - implemented getReviews() function that gets reviews of appropriate businesses from Yelp API. 
implemented Recommendations class, which handles GUI and user interaction, does cosine similarity of user's description 
and reviews of business, creates vectors of user and businesses with appropriate entries, computed angle between them, sorts 
the businesses, and displays top (up to 5) businesses to the user.

Nancy Zhu - implemented users class that gets the category and name that the user types into the GUI text fields and then 
adds them to a history log for the user stored under txt files. The users class provides friend recommendations based on the 
triadic closure property where the most frequent category search history is the common characteristic between the user and 
recommended friend.
